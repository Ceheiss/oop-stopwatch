# Stopwatch Application

This application was an exercise to practice OOP principles, such as constructor functions, define and use private and public properties and methods (abstraction), as well as using getters (for duration property, so it can"t be changed outside of the object).

The tests are used as documentation for what the app is supposed to do.

To run the tests, type `npm run test`
